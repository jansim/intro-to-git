## What is git?

- Version Control System (VCS)
  - Looks at the changes in your files
  - Records all changes over time to give you a full history
  - Similar to "track changes" in Microsoft Word / LibreOffice

## What is git? *Strengths* & Weaknesses

- Strengths 💪
  - Very hard to lose files with git
  - Great for collaboration
  - Fast (like, really fast)
  - History allows you to go back and understand changes or revert when there are problems
  - Reproducibility

## What is git? Strengths & *Weaknesses*

- Weaknesses 😢
  - Can be a bit complicated to use (esp. at first)
  - History takes up file space (but only little)
  - Struggles with binary (i.e. non-text) files
  - Struggles with large files
    - Not good for storing data!
  - You do need to *explicitly* use it i.e. it doesn't just work in the background

## CLI vs. GUI?!

Git can be used via both a CLI and GUI.

*Command Line Interface (CLI)*

- Also Console or Terminal
- Only text
- You type your command, press enter and receive back text
- *Very* flexible, but a bit unintuitive

*Graphical User Interface (GUI)*

- Most applications nowadays
- Often asier to use
- Typically mainly controlled via your Mouse
- Buttons and other clickable elements

## CLI vs. GUI: `git`

- `git` itself is a CLI program
- But, many GUIs are available
  - Sourcetree
  - Visual Studio Code*
  - Rstudio*
  - Github Desktop
  - ... (full list: <https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis>)

*: These programs have a different main purpose, but also offer the option of using git via their GUI.

## Using the `git` CLI

- We will first use git via its CLI (i.e. in the Terminal).
  - On windows, open Git Bash (start menu -> Git Bash).
  - On MacOS, open the Terminal app.
  - On Linux, open your distribution’s (or any other) terminal emulator.
- Let's do this together now!

## Using the `git` cheatsheet to follow along

- There are many existing cheatsheets out there with the most important git commands
- In this course we will be using the one from [GitHub Education](resources/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) to help you navigate the course

## Let's Set Things Up: `git config` ⚙️

Run the following commands in your terminal to correctly configure git on your computer.

```bash
# Add your name
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Add your email address
git config --global user.email "your.email@kit.edu"
```

## Let's Set Things Up: `git config` ⚙️

For Linux/Mac:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

For Windows:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

Why? Windows saves linebreaks (enter) differently then Linux/Mac does 🤷‍♂️

## See what's happening: `git status`

A project in git is called a **repository** (or **repo** for short) and it always corresponds to a directory on your machine.

To see the current status of a git repository you can run the `status` command.

```bash
git status
```

## See what's happening: `git status`

```bash
git status
# fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

We get an error here, because you first need to *initialize* a git repository.

## Initializing a repository: `git init`

Before we can use git in a project we first have to initialize it in the directory of the project. This is done via the `init` command.

```bash
git init
# Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/jan/Dev/temp/test/.git/

git status
# On branch main
# No commits yet
# nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

With `git init` we turn the *directory* into a *repository*.

# Interim: Filepaths

## Interim: What are Filepaths?

- Every file and directory on your computer has a distinct address, its "filepath"
  - That's the names of all the nested directories, separated by `/` (Mac / Linux) or `\` (Windows)
- Filepaths can be either...
  - absolute: `/Users/jan/Dev/temp/example.txt` (we ignore these)
  - relative: `./example.txt`
    - here the path is relative to the working directory `/Users/jan/Dev/temp/`

# Filepaths Demo in Finder

## Practical: Filespaths {background-color="black"}

1. Identify the filepath of the **directory** you created earlier.
2. Open the Terminal
  - Windows: start menu -> Git Bash, MacOS: Terminal app
3. Type `cd`, followed by a space and the path to the directory into the Terminal.
4. Use `pwd` to show your current working directory.
