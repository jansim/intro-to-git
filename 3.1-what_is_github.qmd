## What is GitHub?

- GitHub is a website to host git repositories
- By having your git repository online, you can easily collaborate with others
- There are many other similar, alternative websites
  - Codeberg üá©üá™
  - GitLab
  - Bitbucket
  - ... (and many more)
- Together they contain the majority of the world's software

## Why use a Website?

- Backup of your project
- Collaboration
  - Not just with people you know
- Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)
- Visibility

## Authenticating with GitHub üóùÔ∏è {background-color="black"}

- We will use a great external guide to set up the authentication with GitHub
- Please go to the [website](https://lmu-osc.github.io/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub/SSH.html) and follow the steps to authenticate with GitHub
- A PDF version of the guide can be found [here](./resources/ssh/how-to-setup-github-ssh.pdf)

## Cloning a Repository

- You can download repositories from GitHub (and anywhere else), by *cloning* them
- For public repositories, `git clone` just works, for private ones you will need to be authenticated
- `git clone <remote URL>`

## Cloning a Repository

![You can find the remote URL by going to a repository on GitHub and clicking the Code button](images/screenshots/github-get-remote-url.png)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jansim/intro-to-git.git
```

## Practical: Cloning a private repository {background-color="black"}

1. Go to the website of the repository I added you all to: `https://github.com/open-teaching/git-course-summary-<current-term>`
2. Copy the SSH clone URL from the repositories website
3. Clone the repository to check whether you can authenticate with github

## Remotes

- Link to a remote repository on a hosting website
- There can be more than one remote, but it is uncommon
- Just like your repository, the remote repository also has branches
- The default name for a remote is `origin`
  - When you `clone` a repository, this remote is already linked

## Adding a Remote

When you want to add an existing repository to github, you will have to add the remote yourself

```bash
git remote add <remote name> <remote URL>
```

For example:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:jansim/intro-to-git.git
```

To learn about all possible commands for remotes use `-h`

```bash
git remote -h
```
