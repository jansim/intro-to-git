## Contributing to Open-Source

- Don't be scared to make your own work public
- If you see a project on GitHub you want to contribute to, just comment on an issue
  - People are often happy about contributions
  - It can be a lot of work to maintain a busy project though, so also expect that
- There are also events like: [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)

## Licenses

- Repositories often have a LICENSE file at their root
- This indiciates the LICENSE the code is under and how you are allowed to use it
- If you make your own code / repository public, make sure to pick a proper license
- To help you pick a license: https://choosealicense.com/

## Making your Repository Citeable

- You can assign a doi (digital object identifier) to your repository using [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/about)
  - Steps are outlined in this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content)
- You can also add an official `CITATION` file, so people know how to cite the repository
  - Steps are outlined in this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files)

## Advanced Github

- You can easily start an in-browser version of VSCode on github
  - Just change URL from <https://github.com> to <https://github.dev>
  - Or press the `.` key, inside a repository
- You can automatically run code via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- You can get all sorts of goodies via the [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

## Final Summary

- Initialize a repository with `git init`
- Stage your files with `git add`
- Whenever you made a substantial change, put it into the history with `git commit`
- See your history with `git log`
- Move around (history and branches!) with `git checkout`
- Create new branches with `git checkout -b`
- To collaborate, first `git pull` others changes, then `git push` yours
