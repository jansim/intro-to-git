## Syncing Changes: Overview

You first `pull` the latest changes from the remote and then `push` your own changes

## Getting Changes: `git pull`

- You can retrieve the latest changes from github by running `git pull`
- This *fetches* the latest changes and *merges* them into your current branch
- Typically your local branch is set up to *track* a remote branch with the same name
  - If not, you get a warning from git

::: {.fragment}
```bash
# Pull from the tracked remote branch
git pull

# Pull from a specific branch
git pull <remote>/<branch>
```

## Getting Changes: `git pull`

- This *fetches* the latest changes and *merges* them into your current branch
  - `git pull` really does *two* things here
- You can also run `git fetch` to fetch the latest changes and then `git merge <remote>/branch` to merge them
- `git fetch` will always fetch the latest changes without doing anything with them (which can be useful)

## Pushing Your Changes: `git push`

- You can send *your* changes to github by running `git push`
- This only works if there are no new changes at the remote
  - If there have been changes since your last `pull` you need to `pull` again

::: {.fragment}
```bash
# Push to the tracked remote branch
git push

# Push to a specific branch
git push <remote>/<branch>
```

## Practical: Adding your own repository to Github {background-color="black"}
1. Create a new repository on GitHub with the name `git-intro-example`
    - Make sure NOT to add a README or any other file when creating it
2. In the example git repository we've been working in so far, add the just created GitHub repo as a remote
    - `git remote add origin <URL>`
3. Push you changes so far to GitHub
