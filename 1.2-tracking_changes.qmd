## The 3 Levels of Changes in git

![Changes can be either unstaged, staged or commited.](images/carpentries/git-staging-area.svg)

- When we first make a change it is *unstaged*
- Once we `add` the change to the staging area it is *staged*
- We can then `commit` all *staged* changes

## Tracking Changes: `git add` and `git commit`

![](images/carpentries/git-staging-area.svg)

Files are added to the staging area with <br> `git add <path to file or directory>`

All files in the staging area are commited with <br> `git commit`

## Tracking Changes: `git add`

Files are added to the staging area with <br> `git add <path to file or directory>`.

```bash
# ...we write something into example.txt

git status
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#   example.txt
```

Add `example.txt` to the staging area

```bash
git add example.txt

git status
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#   new file:   example.txt
```

## Tracking Changes: `git add`

Changes are added to the staging area with <br> `git add <path to file or directory>`.

- You can use `git add .` to add all unstaged changes to the staging area
    - `.` always refers to the current directory
- You can also use `*` to represent any sort of filename
  - e.g. add all `.txt` files via `*.txt`

## Tracking Changes: `git commit`

All changes in the staging area are commited with <br> `git commit`

```bash
git status
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#   new file:   example.txt
```

Let's commit the new change
```bash
git commit -m "Creating example.txt"
# [main (root-commit) ed61bb5] Adding example.txt
#  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
#  create mode 100644 example.txt

git status
# On branch main
# nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Tracking changes: `git commit`

- The name git "commit", might already suggest it, but once a change is *commited* it becomes significantly harder to remove it.
- The classic way to undo a commited change in git would be to make another commit with the reverse change.
- Modifying a commit is possible, but you should now what you are doing. Typically this is called "changing history" and is (esp. in collaborative settings) frowned upon.

# Demo: Using git via the CLI

## Tracking changes: Practical (1/2) {background-color="black"}

In between each step, check the repository status with `git status`.

1. Open a terminal in the directory `git-exercise` you created earlier
    - Windows: start menu -> Git Bash, MacOS: Terminal app
2. Initialize a git repository there (`init`)
3. Create a new text file called `hello.txt` with the contents "Hello!"
4. Add the file to the staging area (`add`)
5. Commit the new file (`commit`)

## Tracking changes: Practical (2/2) {background-color="black"}

In between each step, check the repository status with `git status`.

6. Change the text in `hello.txt` to read "Hello there!"
7. Add the file to the staging area (`add`)
8. Commit the new file (`commit`)

## Seeing Changes: `git status`

You can see the high-level changes and what is about to happen with <br>
`git status`

```bash
# ...we change the contents of example.txt

git status
# On branch main
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#         modified:   example.txt

# no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

## Seing Changes: `git diff`

You can see the actual *unstaged* changes, line by line with <br>
`git diff`

```bash
# ...we changed the contents of example.txt

git diff
# diff --git a/example.txt b/example.txt
# index 10ddd6d..980a0d5 100644
# --- a/example.txt
# +++ b/example.txt
# @@ -1 +1 @@
# -Hello!
# +Hello World!
```

:::{.callout-note}
`git diff` only allows you to see changes to files which have already been commited before i.e. changing the contents of an existing file.
:::

## Un-Tracking changes: `git reset`

- You can reset your staging area with `git reset`, removing all staged files
- To remove specific files from the staging area use `git reset <filename / directory>`

```bash
# We add all changes
git add .

git status
# On branch main
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
#         modified:   example.txt

git reset
# Unstaged changes after reset:
# M       example.txt
```

## Un-Doing changes: `git restore`

You can *undo* any changes to files with <br>
`git restore`

```bash
# ...we changed the contents of example.txt

git status
# On branch main
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#         modified:   example.txt

# no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

git restore example.txt

git status
# On branch new-branch
# nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Un-Doing changes: `git restore`

You can *undo* any changes to files with <br>
`git restore`

- This is one of the super-powers of using git, allowing you to just go ahead and change your files without wasting time having to create backups

## Interim: The anatomy of a git command üîçÔ∏è

Git commands, like many other CLI tools follow a certain structure:

```bash
git status

git commit -m "Adding example.txt"

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

With `-h` you can get help on any git command

```bash
git status -h
git commit -h
```

## Practical: Let's create a git command library{background-color="black"}

1. Create a new file `library.txt` in your `git-example` directory
2. Run `git init -h` and copy the output into your `library.txt`
3. Explore the repo status using `git status` and `git diff`
4. Commit the changes (with a good commit message)
5. Delete the `library.txt` and restore it

## Let's get Graphical: Tracking Changes in SourceTree

![The labels in Sourcetree mirror the names within the git CLI](images/screenshots/sourcetree-test.png)

- Demo!

## Practical: Let's create a git command library{background-color="black"}

1. Run `git <command> -h` and copy the output into your `library.txt`
2. Explore the repo status using the GUI
2. Commit the changes (with a good commit message)
5. Repeat steps 2. - 4. for **2 of the commands** we learned so far, using separate commits each time
6. Delete the `library.txt` and restore it

## Let's get Graphical: Tracking Changes in VSCode

![Since VSCode is primarily a text editor, git functionality is hidden in the sidebar](images/screenshots/vscode-git.png)

- Demo!

## Practical: Let's create a git command library{background-color="black"}

1. Create a new file `library.txt` in your `git-example` directory
2. Run `git init -h` and copy the output into your `library.txt`
3. Commit the changes (with a good commit message)
4. Explore the repo status in between 2 and 3 using `git status` and `git diff`
5. Repeat steps 2. - 4. for **2 of the commands** we learned so far, using separate commits each time
6. Delete the `library.txt` and restore it

## Practical: Binary Files {background-color="black"}

1. Create a Word document called `library.docx` and copy over the contents from `library.txt`
2. Run `git stash -h` and copy the output into both `library.docx` and `library.txt`
3. Use `git diff` to compare how the same change is recognized by git in the two documents

# Temporarily Storing Changes: `git stash`

- If you're not yet ready to commit your changes, but want to quickly store them and work on something else, you can do so with `git stash`
- When stashing your changes, all changes will be removed (similarly to `git restore`), but they will be saved
- See all stashes via `git stash list`
- Apply your stahes via `git stash apply`
